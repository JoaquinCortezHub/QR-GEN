# QR GENERATION

This website was made using React, TypeScript and Toastify for the push notifications.

To run this repo locally:

- npm install
- npm run dev

## Why This Project??

I built this project as a way to practice React and Typescript, but mostly because I want to later work on a bigger project
where a QR-Code generation feature is needed, so I decided to break down the problem into tiny projects to familiarize myself
with the technologies I want to use in this bigger project.

## Features

The main features of this project are:

- Generate a QR-Code based on the input provided by the user.
- The QR-Code can be downloaded as an image.
- The user gets feedback in the form of push notifications.
- The input is validated to prevent useless codes.

## What I learned

With this project, I could get used to working with state in React, managing the validation and storage of the input and using basic
TypeScript functionalities. I also learned how to work with the 'qrcode' library and with the 'Toastify' library.

Now I'm more concious of how to start building features that are solid in a way that they can be coded quickly, they are easy to read,
and they can later be reused in bigger projects.
